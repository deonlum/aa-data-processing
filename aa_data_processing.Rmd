## Steps
- Get the functions from the source file 
- Input the appropriate `file_name` and run clean_aa_data to keep sample data
- Optional: Run subtract_blanks to remove blank values from samples


## Cleaning data file

Read in function using `source_url`:

```{r, message = FALSE}
devtools::source_url("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/deonlum/aa-data-processing/main/AA_functions.R")
```

Input your file name into the clean_aa_data function. Note the file has to be a .csv file. Convert the .SLK file in excel (save as comma delimited).

```{r}
file_name = "./sample_data.csv"

clean_data = clean_aa_data(file_name)
clean_data

```

What `clean_aa_data` does is pick out the appropriate cells in the .csv file and puts it all in a nice dataframe for downstream processing. It does not alter any values at all. clean_aa_data also prints out what data columns were identified. In this case, this was a KCl run, so it retrieved data for Ammonia and Nitrate.

Notice that in the sample data file (which is a truncated version of a real data file), there are multiple sets of samples. First, there are samples with A and B on them for KCl-A and KCl-B. And there are also samples from two timepoints: samples 1A/B to 6A/B are from T1, and all samples with the 'S' label are from the control timepoint. I also have an unwanted SPARE sample at the end.

## Auto-detect and subtract blanks

`subtract_blanks` will identify blanks, take the average, and subtract this value from all samples. This means if we run the function on the current dataframe, it will calculate an average using **all** the blanks (e.g., T1 BLANK 1, CONTROL BLANK 1) and subtract it from **all** the samples, which is not what we want.

To make sure we get the intended behaviour (e.g. only subtract T1 blanks from T1 samples), we can subset the relevant rows.


```{r}
T1_data = clean_data[1:15,]
T1_data

```

And now:

```{r}
subtract_blanks(T1_data, blank_pattern = "BLANK")

```

Note that we have to specify the blank_pattern here (which is case-sensitive). The default is "B" which doesn't work here since "B" is used to denote KCL-B samples. As an alternative, one can also specify rows:

```{r}
my_data = subtract_blanks(T1_data, blank_rows = c(13:15))

```

At this point, it might also be useful to separate A and B values, or fumigated and unfumigated ones if doing microbial biomass N. A quick tip is to use grep() to retrieve relevant rows (also useful to subset differently labelled sites for `subtract_blanks`):

```{r}
KCLA = my_data[grep("A", my_data$sample_id),]
KCLB = my_data[grep("B", my_data$sample_id),]

KCLA
KCLB
```
